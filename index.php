                <h2>Who is <?php echo $firstName.$lastName; ?>?</h2>
                <p> <?php echo $firstName; ?> Joseph <?php echo $lastName; ?> (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, record producer, dancer, and actor. Called the "King of Pop", his contributions to music, dance, and fashion along with his publicized personal
                    life made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. The eighth child of the <?php echo $lastName; ?> family (one of whom died in infancy), <?php echo $firstName; ?> made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine,
                    and Marlon as a member of the <?php echo $lastName; ?> 5. He began his solo career in 1971. In the early 1980s, <?php echo $lastName; ?> became a dominant figure in popular music. His music videos, including those of "Beat It", "Billie Jean", and "Thriller" from his
                    1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. The popularity of these videos helped bring the television channel MTV to fame. <?php echo $lastName; ?>'s 1987 album
                    Bad spawned the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "I Just Can't Stop Loving You", "Bad", "The Way You Make Me Feel", "Man in the Mirror", and "Dirty Diana", becoming the first album to have five number-one singles on the Billboard
                    Hot 100. He continued to innovate with videos such as "Black or White" and "Scream" throughout the 1990s, and forged a reputation as a touring solo artist. Through stage and video performances, <?php echo $lastName; ?> popularized a number of complicated
                    dance techniques, such as the robot and the moonwalk, to which he gave the name. His distinctive sound and style has influenced numerous artists of various music genres. Thriller is the best-selling album of all time, with estimated
                    sales of 65 million copies worldwide. <?php echo $lastName; ?>'s other albums, including Off the Wall (1979), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory (1995), also rank among the world's best-selling albums. </p>

                <h2>Who are his influences?</h2>
                <p>
                    <?php echo $lastName; ?> was influenced by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. According to choreographer David Winters, who met and
                    befriended <?php echo $lastName; ?> while choreographing the 1971 Diana Ross TV special Diana!, <?php echo $lastName; ?> watched the musical West Side Story almost every week, and it was his favorite film; he paid tribute to it in "Beat It" and the "Bad" video. While
                    Little Richard had a substantial influence on <?php echo $lastName; ?>, James Brown was <?php echo $lastName; ?>'s greatest inspiration. In reference to Brown, <?php echo $lastName; ?> declared: "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake
                    me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I had never seen a performer perform like James Brown, and
                    right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do for the rest of my life because of James Brown." <?php echo $lastName; ?>'s wax statue at the Madame Tussauds The young <?php echo $lastName; ?> owed his vocal technique in large part to Diana Ross. Not
                    only a mother figure to him, she was often observed in rehearsal as an accomplished performer. He later said: "I got to know her well. She taught me so much. I used to just sit in the corner and watch the way she moved. She was art
                    in motion. I studied the way she moved, the way she sang – just the way she was." He told her: "I want to be just like you, Diana." She said: "You just be yourself." <?php echo $lastName; ?> owed part of his enduring style—especially his use of the
                    oooh interjection—to Ross. From a young age, <?php echo $lastName; ?> often punctuated his verses with a sudden exclamation of oooh. Diana Ross had used this effect on many of the songs recorded with the Supremes.
